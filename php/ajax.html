<h1>AJAX</h1>
<h2>What is AJAX ?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.</li>
    <li>AJAX is not a programming language.</li>
    <li>AJAX just uses a combination of:</li>
    <li>AJAX just uses a combination of:</li>
    <li>A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server).
        JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).
        AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.</li>
    <li>AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update a web page without reloading the page.</li>
<li>Request data from a server - after the page has loaded.</li>
<li>Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded.</li>
<li>Send data to a server - in the background.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How AJAX works</h2>
<ul>
<li>An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked).</li>
<li>An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript.</li>
<li>The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server.</li>
<li>The server processes the request.</li>
<li>The server sends a response back to the web page.</li>
<li>The response is read by JavaScript.</li>
<li>Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AJAX Technologies</h2>
<p>The technologies that are used by AJAX are already implemented in all the Morden browsers. So the client does not require any extra module to run the AJAX application.The technologies used by AJAX are .. </p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript &#45 It is an important part of AJAX. It allows you to create client-side functionality. Or we can say that it is used to create AJAX applications.</li>
<li>XML &#45 It is used to exchange data between web server and client.</li>
<li>The XMLHttpRequest &#45 It is used to perform asynchronous data exchange between a web browser and a web server.</li>
<li>HTML and CSS &#45 It is used to provide markup and style to the webpage text.</li>
<li>DOM &#45 It is used to interact with and alter the webpage layout and content dynamically.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of AJAX</h2>
<h3>The following are the advantages of AJAX &#45</h3>
<ul>
<li>It creates responsive and interactive web applications.</li>
<li>It supports the development of patterns and frameworks that decrease the development time.</li>
<li>It makes the best use of existing technology and feature instead of using some new technology.</li>
<li>It makes an asynchronous call to the web server which means the client doesn't have to wait for the data to arrive before starting rendering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of AJAX</h2>
<h3>The following are the disadvantages of AJAX &#45</h3>
<ul>
<li>AJAX is fully dependent on Javascript. So if anything happens with javascript in the browser AJAX will not support.</li>
<li>The debugging of AJAX applications is difficult.</li>
<li>Bookmarking of AJAX-enabled pages required pre-planning.</li>
<li>If one request can fail then it can fail the load of the whole webpage.</li>
<li>If JavaScript is disabled in your web browser then you are not able to run the AJAX webpage.</li>
</ul>
