    <h1>Access Modifiers</h1>
    <p>
      Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they
      can be accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is
      default protected - the property or method can be accessed within the
      class and by classes derived from that class private - the property or
      method can ONLY be accessed within the class
    </p>
    <h2>The public access modifier</h2>
    <p>
      When you place the public keyword in front of a property or a method, the
      property or method becomes public. It means that you can access the
      property and method from both inside and outside of the class.
    </p>
    <p>The following example illustrates the public access modifier:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../img/accessmodi.png" alt="public modifier image" class="img-small">
    </div>
    <h2>The private access modifier</h2>
    <p>
      To prevent access to properties and methods from outside of the class, you
      use the private access modifier.
    </p>
    <p>The following example illustrates the private access modifier:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="/img/accessmodi1.png" alt="" class="img-medium">
    </div>
    <h2>Why do you need private property?</h2>
    <p>
      It may be faster to use the public access modifier for properties instead
      of using a private property with the public getter/setter. However, by
      using the private property, you can prevent direct access to the property
      from the outside of the class. In addition, the getter/setter methods
      ensure that the only way to access the property is through these methods.
      And the getter/setter methods can provide custom logic to manipulate the
      property value.
    </p>
    <h2>The protected access modifier</h2>
    <p>
      The protected keyword is an access modifier. It marks a property or method
      as protected. Protected properties and methods can only be used by the
      class in which the property or method was defined and any classes that
      derive from it. Any other code cannot use them.
    </p>
    <p>The following example illustrates the protected access modifier:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="/img/accessmodi2.png" alt="" class="img-medium">
    </div>
  </body>
